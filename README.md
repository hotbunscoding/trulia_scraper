This project is designed to webscrape Trulia for homes based on the desired city and state. 

SQLite3 is used to create and connect to a local database stored on the user's device. You can then either use a database viewer or create manual SQL queries to filter homes based on your desired filters.

Future functionality that I would like to implement is the following:

<li>Ability to export to a CSV file</li>
<li>Ability to add additional filters to the search</li>
<li>Integrating with Google Places APIs to determine the distance to desirable places like restaurants, shopping malls, parks, etc. from the selected home</li>
