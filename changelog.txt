- Fixed issue where export to CSV wouldn't export any data. This is caused by the user searching for homes in a city
and state that does not exist. For example, searching for homes in "Charlotte, AK" would cause Trulia to redirect to
trulia.com/AK instead of producing a 404. Export functionality now checks to make sure there is data to write and if
there is none, it instead writes data for the homes in that state in general.
- Included date time in exported file name so that previous exports are not overwritten
and will always generate a unique file
